# VGM_streamer_buffering
Software for VGM playback with [PSoniC Mega Drive Player](https://github.com/the4lchemist/PSoC5LP_MegaDrive_player).
 
The code was developed in C and tested under Windows 10. It is compatible with uncompressed VGM files only (no VGZ/playlists).
 
In order to play VGZ and m3u, the streamer.py along with streamer.bat scripts must be used from Python_script_v1 folder. NOTE: requires gzip.exe.

For a compact solution, full compatible with VGM, VGZ, and playlists, check out [here](https://github.com/the4lchemist/VGM_streamer_Py).
